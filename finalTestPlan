VARIABLES:
  coin
  collector
  left arrow
  pepper
  right arrow
  up arrow
  down arrow

TEST CASE 1:

  INPUT VALUES:
  left arrow

  EXPECTED RESULT:
  left arrow = collector walks to the left into wall
  coins slowly descend and bounce
  pepper descends and bounces

  ACTUAL RESULT:
  collector walks to left into wall
  coins slowly descend and bounce with spin animation
  pepper descends and bounces

TEST CASE 2:

  INPUT VALUES:
  left arrow
  right arrow
  EXPECTED RESULT:
  left arrow = collector walks into wall to the left
  right arrow = collector begins walking to the right
  coins slowly descend and bounce with spin animation
  pepper descends and bounces

  ACTUAL RESULT:
  left arrow = collector walks into wall to the left
  right arrow = collector begins walking to the right
  coins slowly descend and bounce with spin animation
  pepper descends and bounces

TEST CASE 3:

  INPUT VALUES:
  left arrow
  right arrow
  up arrow

  EXPECTED RESULT:
  left arrow = collector walks to the left
  right arrow = collector is able to walk to the right
  up arrow = collector jumps up and collects coins

  ACTUAL RESULT:
  left arrow = collector walks to the left
  right arrow = collector is able to walk to the right
  up arrow = collector jumps up and collects coins
  coins slowly descend and bounce with spin animation
  pepper descends and bounces

TEST CASE 4:

  INPUT VALUES:
  left arrow
  right arrow
  up arrow
  down arrow
  EXPECTED RESULT:
  left arrow = collector walks to the left
  right arrow = collector walks to the right
  up arrow = collector jumps
  down arrow = collectors descend feels controlled when pressed in air
  coins slowly descend and bounce with spin animation
  pepper descends and bounces

  ACTUAL RESULT:
  left arrow = collector walks to the left
  right arrow = collector walks to the right
  up arrow = collector jumps
  down arrow = collectors descend feels controlled when pressed in air
  coins slowly descend and bounce with spin animation
  pepper descends and bounces

TEST CASE 5:

  INPUT VALUES:


  EXPECTED RESULT:
  collector sits there
  coins slowly descend and bounce with spin animation
  pepper descends and bounces

  ACTUAL RESULT:
  collector sits there
  coins slowly descend and bounce with spin animation
  pepper descends and bounces


TEST CASE 6:

  INPUT VALUES:
  left arrow
  right arrow
  up arrow
  down arrow
  click on screen
  EXPECTED RESULT:
  left arrow = collector walks to the left
  right arrow = collector walks to the right
  up arrow = collector jumps
  down arrow = collectors descend feels controlled when pressed in air
  coins slowly descend and bounce with spin animation
  pepper descends and bounces
  more coins begin to spawn

  ACTUAL RESULT:
  left arrow = collector walks to the left
  right arrow = collector walks to the right
  up arrow = collector jumps
  down arrow = collectors descend feels controlled when pressed in air
  coins slowly descend and bounce with spin animation
  pepper descends and bounces

TEST PLAN 7

  INPUT VALUES:
  left arrow
  right arrow
  up arrow
  down arrow
  click on screen
  EXPECTED RESULT:
  left arrow = collector walks to the left
  right arrow = collector walks to the right
  up arrow = collector jumps onto platform
  down arrow = collectors descend feels controlled when pressed in air
  coins slowly descend and bounce with spin animation
  pepper descends and bounces
  more coins begin to spawn

  ACTUAL RESULT:
  left arrow = collector walks to the left
  right arrow = collector walks to the right
  up arrow = collector jumps onto platform 
  down arrow = collectors descend feels controlled when pressed in air
  coins slowly descend and bounce with spin animation
  pepper descends and bounces
